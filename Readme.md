# Spidey Game

Welcome to the **Spidey Game**! This is a fun, interactive game implemented in Python using the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface, `pygame` for background music, and `Pillow` for handling images. The game features engaging visuals, sounds, and random challenges to test your reflexes and strategy.

## Features

- **Graphical Interface**: Built with `tkinter` for a user-friendly experience.
- **Sound Effects**: Background music and sound effects are implemented using `pygame`.
- **Random Challenges**: Each gameplay session is unique thanks to random elements.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs on any system with Python and required libraries installed.

## Requirements

To run the game, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or newer
